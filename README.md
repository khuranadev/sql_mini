# Mini SQL Engine in Python

A lightweight SQL interpreter built using core Python data structures. This project replicates the functionality of a basic SQL database with support for commands such as `CREATE`, `INSERT`, `SELECT`, and conditional filtering—executed fully in memory without external libraries. It serves as an educational demonstration of how SQL parsing and execution work internally.
